# LiveLot Admin Portal üêõ
Welcome to the LiveLot Admin Portal code base, this repo will hold our beautiful admin portal one day.

Right now the project is bootstrapped with React, TypeScript, Jest, and Webpack.

## Local Development
For local development, we run our application in a Docker using the webpack dev server. When we move to PROD we will create a separate container 
that will server our PROD webpack bundle using an NGINX proxy.

### `yarn start`
To start the stack locally run.

```shell
yarn start
```

This will spin up the webpack dev server in a docker container to ensure that development is the same on everybody's machine.

The webpack dev server is available externally on your local machine at `http://localhost:6931`

### `yarn dev`
If you don't want to run the webpack dev server in a docker container, you can just expose this locally by running

```shell
yarn dev
```

The webpack dev server will run on port 6931 at `http://localhost:6931`

### `yarn test`

We are also leveraging Jest and `@testing-library/react` for our unit/integration tests. To run these locally run

```shell
yarn test
```
